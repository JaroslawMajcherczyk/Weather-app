This is a weather app built with React and Vite template. 


Tools were used to create the application:
-Tailwind CSS
-IconScout
-luxon
-react-toastify

API is downloaded from Openweather API: https://openweathermap.org/

You can create an account there to generate your own private IPA key, but I leave mine in the code.

Another possibility to develop the application are planning is to expand it with a map with global precipitation.
